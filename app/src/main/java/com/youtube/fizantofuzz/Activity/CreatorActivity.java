Partnering with my friend Aryan, we began producing videos focused on game recordings and topical roasts. Aryan managed the video editing and design, while I was responsible for voice-over recordings, scriptwriting, and acting, especially since Aryan is an introvert.</p>\n" +

                "    <p>Balancing my studies, particularly during my board exams, limited my time for the channel. Despite this, we persevered and continued posting videos on YouTube. Among our projects, the <strong>\"Quba Mobile Roast\"</strong> video stands out as a personal favorite due to its excellent script and performance, even though, in hindsight, there were areas for improvement.</p>\n" +

                "    <p>The eighteen months dedicated to our channel were incredibly rewarding, involving days spent scripting, acting, and engaging with our audience, whose feedback was immensely gratifying. Currently, my focus is on my studies, leaving little time for YouTube. Nonetheless, the experience imparted valuable skills, particularly in acting and cinematography.</p>\n" +

In March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic led to a nationwide lockdown, we suddenly had a lot of free time. Prateek and I decided to launch a YouTube channel named Fizanto Fuzzâ€”credit for the name goes to Prateek.</p>\n" +

However, as the lockdown eased, our schedules became busier, and we could no longer dedicate time to making videos.</p>\n" +

Over the past two years, I have diligently coded, managed, and updated the app. Reflecting on our old videos, they may seem cringe-worthy now, but the experience was invaluable, helping us acquire new skills. I developed a deep interest in professional video editing and graphics design.</p>\n" +
